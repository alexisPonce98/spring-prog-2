# spring-prog-2
This program was made for an assignment for one of my classes. The main principle of the application is to first be able to parse a given program
that was written according the grammar that my professor had set up. While parsing we would resolve the scopes of the given variables using data strucutures of our choice.
NOTE: I alone only wrote the parser.cc file, i do not take credit for any other work.
